# LIRI
A Node based SIRI CLI app that makes searches to Spotify, BandsInTown, and OMDB API's.

# To begin just type "node liri" in the command line and hit enter
LIRI will then give you the options for how use the app.

## Search Concerts with Bands In Town
To search for a concert just type "node liri concert-this <the name of an artist who is touring>".
LIRI will then take the search and apply it to the Bands In Town API and return the soonest result for a concert for that artist.

LIRI will search the Spotify API and return several relevant results including links to listen to a portion of the song. **Below is an image of a Spotify search. I underlined in red how to type the command.**

## Search Movies with OMDB
To search for a movie just type "node liri movie-this <the title of a movie>".
LIRI will search the Open Movie Database API and return the most relevant movie as well as Rotten Tomatoes score, year, actors, plot and more. **Below is an image of an OMDB search. I underlined in red how to type the command.**

## Search something random
Lastly, if you're not sure what to search for you can simply run: "node liri do-what-it-says".
This will return a random search from the file "random.txt". It could be a movie, concert, or song result. **Below is an image of a random search. I underlined in red how to type the command.**

## To creat LIRI ...
I had to get access to the three API's that were used to power the app; Spotify, BandsInTown, and OMDB. I created a .env file to hide the Spotify keys. These included a Client ID and a Secret Key. These were then called into a keys.js file, which was then required into the main liri.js file. This allows the keys to remain secret even while saving my work publicly to GitHub.

I mention this both so that you know how I got the app to work as well as so that you could run the app yourself if you would like to clone the repository.

To get the random search with the do-what-it-says command I used the core fs package that is native to node. Using this I was able to run a search on a different document in the directory (random.txt). Inside of that file was held a random command and search value. Currently it holds "movie-this,Silverado", but can be updated to hold any of the three searches (movie, song, or concert).
